Create a Library class that has the following attributes:

books: a list of Book objects
borrowers: a list of Borrower objects
The Library class should have the following methods:

add_book(): adds a new Book object to the books list
remove_book(): removes a Book object from the books list
add_borrower(): adds a new Borrower object to the borrowers list
remove_borrower(): removes a Borrower object from the borrowers list
lend_book(): updates the status of a Book object to "borrowed" and assigns it to a Borrower object
return_book(): updates the status of a Book object to "available" and removes it from a Borrower object's borrowed books list
Create a Book class that has the following attributes:

title: the title of the book
author: the author of the book
isbn: the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) of the book
status: the status of the book (either "available" or "borrowed")
Create a Borrower class that has the following attributes:

name: the name of the borrower
borrowed_books: a list of Book objects that the borrower has borrowed
Your task is to implement the Library class and the Book and Borrower classes in Java, and write code to test their functionality. 
For example, you could create a Library object, add some Book and Borrower objects to it, lend some books to borrowers, and return some books.
